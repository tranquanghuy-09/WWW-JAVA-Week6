                    <h5>What is something Vietnamese people didn't realise was very Vietnamese until they went abroad?</h5>
                    <p style="box-sizing: border-box; text-align: justify; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;">This is a real picture of me and my classmates visiting our high school teacher on New Year’s a few years back, about 10 years after our graduation! We do this at least once every year, visiting a handful of the teachers that spent the most time with us. The number has been shrinking every year because more of us have got married and have family obligations, but generally, we do make an effort to make it happen. I am pretty sure we will keep doing this as long as they are alive. During the Tet holiday (Lunar New Year), our teachers can be visited by hundreds of old students, sometimes multiple classes at once. Quite amazing they can remember us all!

                        <br>The visit is a boisterous occasion with a lot of good-spirited gossiping going around and updating each other how everyone is doing after a year apart.

                        <br>In Vietnam, high school students stay in the same class with a couple of the same key teachers throughout three years. It is enough time to build really strong bonds and friendships, among students, and between teachers and students. We look up to them not merely as imparters of knowledge, but mentors, counselors and inspirers. As in my case, our teachers played a significant role in our moral and emotional development, helping us navigate the turbulent yet exhilarating years of adolescence and young adulthood, for which we feel deeply indebted. I don’t know whether this tradition is still as strong today, but I certainly hope we continue to uphold it.</p>
